# Agile
Allows us to adapt to changing requirements, doesn't enforce a strict schedule, allows us to still
be flexible and productive.
# Waterfall
"do the entire SDLC as a single process" - no real flexibility (although maybe a bit less admin overhead)

# Small project
low stakes
you can use the technologies you've already learned (java, sql with h2, javalin) , or anything else you find useful
topic can be anything - business professional

# Rapid prototyping
